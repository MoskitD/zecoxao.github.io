<h1 id="playstation-5-development-kit">PlayStation 5 Development Kit</h1>
<p><img src="img/banner.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Today we&#39;ll be taking a look at the initial prototype PlayStation 5 development kit, and the steps necessary to disassemble the kit down to the motherboard.</p>
<p>The disassembly may vary between the various prototype and release versions of the dev kit, but the overall steps likely will remain the same.</p>
<h2 id="supplies">Supplies</h2>
<ul>
<li>T8 Torx Screwdriver</li>
<li>00 Philips Screwdriver</li>
<li>Wedge Tool</li>
<li>2.5-inch tall plastic box</li>
<li>Parts Tray (Be warned: there are A LOT of screws)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKH2DC3K">Liquid Metal Kit</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
<p>At the time of publication, there was no existing teardown guide, nor any photographs of the internals of one of the PS5 kits. The disassembly (if you know what you&#39;re doing) is not hard, but it is tedious, so please don&#39;t attempt this unless you have adequate time on your hands.</p>
<p><img src="img/top-view.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the underside of the dev kit are two screws for the M.2 drive bay (later models will have three screws). This panel will need to be removed as it holds the inner metal enclosure to the plastic dev kit case.</p>
<p>Remove the screws to reveal the M.2 drive bay:</p>
<p><img src="img/underside-screws.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Inside the M.2 drive bay are five more screws. You will need to remove the four screws circled in red in order to remove the M.2 board later.</p>
<p><img src="img/nvme-slot.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, on the face of the unit are 8 T8 Torx screws. </p>
<p><img src="img/front-torx-screws.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Removing all 8 will allow you to pull away the faceplate of the dev kit:</p>
<p><img src="img/faceplate-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are two more Torx screws on both sides of the unit, of which one is circled here:</p>
<p><img src="img/fp-rm-side.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After you remove the Torx screw, you will be able to pull the side fin back and away:</p>
<p><img src="img/side-fin-pull.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Do the same for the other side:</p>
<p><img src="img/side-pulled-out-other.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Removing both side fins will reveal the triple fan clusters on each side:</p>
<p><img src="img/side-fin-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We now need to remove the top plastic cover. Adjacent to each fan is a black screw to remove (6 in total):</p>
<p><img src="img/fan-screws.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/fan-screws-other.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the top plastic cover is also held in place by two clips located near the back of the unit in this general area:</p>
<p><img src="img/back-clips-location.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/back-clips.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/v-plate-clips.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Use your wedge tool in order to unhook the clips to allow you to get the top cover free. You should be able to lift the top cover in a clamshell fashion like shown once the clips are free:</p>
<p><img src="img/v-plate-propped.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And now our kit is topless!</p>
<p><img src="img/topless.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As pictured above, the left half of the V is another plastic cover that houses our MASSIVE heatsink, while the right half houses the unit&#39;s power supply.</p>
<p>Continuing disassembly, we need to loosen and/or remove a series of different-sized screws. Do not lose track of them!</p>
<p>(Also beware that the top-rightmost blue circle requires a longer Philips screwdriver, as the screw is deep inside the hole)</p>
<p><img src="img/uncovered-screw-locations.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Near the front are the three fan plugs, which you&#39;ll also need to carefully disconnect. Be careful to not grab the connector, as you could rip the connector off!</p>
<p><img src="img/trifan-plugs.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Around the back are two more screws holding the inner V components in place:</p>
<p><img src="img/topless-back.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the two screws in the back are removed (not shown here), you will need to lift the V halves like so:</p>
<p><img src="img/topless-back-removal-order.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Be careful removing the power supply half (the blue side), as it plugs into the motherboard. You might need to use <em>some</em> force, but not a lot.</p>
<p>After you remove both halves of the V enclosure, you should be met with our monster heatsink.</p>
<p><img src="img/power-supply-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we need to remove the CP screen. There are two screws hidden behind it, as well as a USB type C cable plugged in. Remove all three:</p>
<p><img src="img/remove-cp-screen.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once removed, there are 8 silver flathead screws around the motherboard plate, indicated like so:</p>
<p><img src="img/after-cp-removal.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once all 8 screws are removed, you should be able to yoink out the metal box enclosure:</p>
<p><img src="img/extract-main-box.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you cannot lift the metal box out from the sides, check to make sure you removed the bottom cover screws as done in one of the first steps.</p>
<p>Next up, we need to disconnect both of the rear fans from the motherboard. Again, be sure to pull on the white part, and not the yellow connector!</p>
<p><img src="img/rear-fan-1-unplugged.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/rear-fan-2-unplugged.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&#39;s where you&#39;ll need the 2.5-inch tall box, as you will need something to support and balance the 2nd half of the motherboard while we work on the underside. Place the plastic box down, and flip over the metal enclosure on top like so:</p>
<p><img src="img/use-support-balance.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the back are two rear fans with diagonally-placed screws. These screws are very long and have washers on them. Be careful removing the screws, as you don&#39;t want to lose the washers accidentally:</p>
<p><img src="img/rearview-fans-box.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/rear-fans-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We must now remove 29 small black screws around the lip of the metal enclosure, circled below:</p>
<p><img src="img/main-box-screws-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There&#39;s also a roundhead silver screw holding the USB type C cable you&#39;ll also need to remove:</p>
<p><img src="img/main-box-screws-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/main-box-screws-3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/main-box-screws-4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Phew! After all 29 screws are removed plus the USB type C screw, you should be able to simply lift the bottom of the metal enclosure up from the motherboard:</p>
<p><img src="img/lift-main-box-bottom.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We&#39;ll be met with some interesting pieces; namely, the SM2-K12 M.2 drive board, as well as potentially a Blu-ray drive if your unit has one. In my case, there is an internal HDD in this kit, which we&#39;ll need to disconnect and remove.</p>
<p><img src="img/overhead-sm2-k12.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Begin by locating the following 4-wire connector and ribbon cable:</p>
<p><img src="img/cables-sm2-k12.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Peel back the black tape on the ribbon cable, and flip the clasp up to pull the ribbon cable. Pull out the 4-wire connector like so:</p>
<p><img src="img/cables-sm2-k12-unplugged.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You should now be able to pull out the M.2 drive board. There is a small peg at the opposite end you need to push back to free the board as you lift up.</p>
<p>Next, remove the hard drive SATA cable if the kit has it.</p>
<p><img src="img/unplug-sata-cable-hdd.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I recommend unplugging all the cables from the motherboard, as it will make further disassembly easier. (I will leave the ribbon cable in my case)</p>
<p><img src="img/all-cables-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Our goal is to now remove the black plastic drive enclosure, which is held in place by 10 roundhead silver screws, each position shown below:</p>
<p><img src="img/plastic-enclosure-screws-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/plastic-enclosure-screws-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/plastic-enclosure-screws-3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/plastic-enclosure-screws-4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="img/plastic-enclosure-screws-5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Removing all 10 silver screws will allow you to pull the plastic enclosure up and off:</p>
<p><img src="img/plastic-enclosure-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Almost done! We can almost see all of the backside of the motherboard.</p>
<p><img src="img/sano-k12-overhead.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>But now we have one of the most tedious and obnoxious screw removal phases to work through.</p>
<p><img src="img/sano-k12-overhead-screws.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are:</p>
<ul>
<li>26 small silver screws (red)</li>
<li>18 small black screws (blue)</li>
<li>4 hexagonal post screws (pink)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the black screws have gold arrows pointing to them on the motherboard if the picture is not clear enough.</p>
<p>After you remove all the screws, you will want to take off the metal shielding covering the clamp. You can <em>gently</em> slide your wedge tool under the shielding to try and pry it off.</p>
<p>The shielding is likely stuck due to the thermal pads. Be <em>very</em> careful to not pry too hard and bump any small components near the shielding as you move around.</p>
<p><img src="img/sano-k12-shield-pry-tool.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&#39;s what it should look like with the shielding removed:</p>
<p><img src="img/sano-k12-shield-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We&#39;re now met with another few scary parts: removing the clamp and flipping the board. We need to unscrew two screws as indicated below. However, you want to progressively unscrew both at the same time--i.e., unscrew one a little, then unscrew the other a little, and repeat until the screws are loose. </p>
<p>This will help prevent straining the board too much from one remaining screw. </p>
<p><img src="img/sano-k12-clamp.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Lift both the clamp and the plastic portion off, and we will now be able to see the entire backside of the motherboard! From here, you should be able to lift the motherboard up off the metal plate with the heat sink.</p>
<p>Do so <em>carefully</em>! There is liquid metal that could drip. Lift the motherboard, and quickly flip to prevent any liquid metal from dripping out. </p>
<p><strong>WARNING: If you drip any liquid metal, you MUST clean it up as any drippage left on the board could result in short circuits and damage or fry the dev kit.</strong></p>
<p><img src="img/sano-k12-clamp-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is what it should look like after removing and flipping the motherboard:</p>
<p><img src="img/heatsink-plate-removed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Congratulations! We&#39;ve completely disassembled the PS5 dev kit. You are now free to change the CR2032 battery, probe points with a multimeter, apply fresh liquid metal, etc.</p>
<p><img src="img/motherboard.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="img/pizzastation.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My goal with writing this guide is to both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide insight into the mysterious PS5 dev kit for educational purposes, and</li>
<li>Spare people in the future the agonizing trial-and-error process I had to go through when trying to disassemble this (prototype) PS5 dev kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to me disassembling the kit, there were rumors about the kit being riveted shut, or similar, requiring the kit to be drilled open. Fortunately that is not the case!</p>
<p>The first time, it took about 10 hours to photograph and document everything such as which part to remove and when, as well as all where each screw goes, and thus this guide will save you from the agony of going into it blindly.</p>
<p>I hope you found this guide informative, or useful in trying to teardown your own PS5 dev kit. 😊 If you&#39;re interested in learning more about this kit, see the following wiki articles:</p>
